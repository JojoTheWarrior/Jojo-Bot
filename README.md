# Jojo-Bot
As every programmer started off somewhere, this Discord bot was my first program. I originally made it to learn more Python and explore the Discord.py Class, but I got a bit carried away and turned it into more of a games and niche utilities Discord bot. The Jojo-Bot was created 10/12/2020.

Today is the first day of my log, obviously things happened before, I just did not write them down. This program was written in PyCharm, and it was moved around a few times so I don't have a good record of its origins. I would consider myself to be pretty fluent in Python, but only really in a competitive coding sense, as the actual Object Oriented Programming, utilities, organizers, etc. cannot be taught, I have to learn those from experience.

I'm not really sure where I want to go with this, I have a lot to learn and a lot more to explore. Hopefully I can implement some useful and interesting commands so that my high school server can mess around with this bot. If I could create something that actually influenced somebody and helped them, even just one person, that would mean everything to me. Obviously this is just a Discord bot, but to me, it's not really the Discord bot that matters; this is my first project and my first chance to gain experience using GitHub to manage a project, which is surely something that I will get better at later on.

I'm unsure of what to do next, but my most feasible goal is to find a way to keep this bot running 24/7.

I really thought that I would be keeping up with this log more. I started working on my Metropolis application, since this seems like an opportunity for me to finally start learning how to work on a real project and use GitHub better. I downloaded GitHub desktop, as well as Visual Studio Code, and I'm just trying to mess around to see how these pieces fit together (this is pretty complicated...). I might also experiment some jojoMethod today so that I have a piece of code to experiment with. Hopefully this goes well.

Made my first commit on my local computer to the GitHub (it did not work). Watching some YouTube tutorials to figure this out.

Posted the bot publicly, then Discord disabled my bot because I accidentally revealed the token =P. Made some formatting changes and removed unnecessary/obsolete commands. Made the code public again but without the token.
