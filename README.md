Today is the first day of my log, obviously things happened before, I just did not write them down. This program was written in PyCharm, and it was moved around a few times so I don't have a good record of its origins. I would consider myself to be pretty fluent in Python, but only really in a competitive coding sense, as the actual Object Oriented Programming, utilities, organizers, etc. cannot be taught, I have to learn those from experience.

I'm not really sure where I want to go with this, I have a lot to learn and a lot more to explore. Hopefully I can implement some useful and interesting commands so that my high school server can mess around with this bot. If I could create something that actually influenced somebody and helped them, even just one person, that would mean everything to me. Obviously this is just a Discord bot, but to me, it's not really the Discord bot that matters; this is my first project and my first chance to gain experience using GitHub to manage a project, which is surely something that I will get better at later on.

I'm unsure of what to do next, but my most feasible goal is to find a way to keep this bot running 24/7.
